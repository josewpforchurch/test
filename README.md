To get the most of the theme, you have to ensure that all plugins are updated and of the latest version as to date. This will ensure that the theme will run efficiently.

 1. Click on the **Dashboard** menu item from the sidebar menu.
 2. Often times, when a plugin needs to be updated, an **Updates** menu item will appear just below the Dashboard menu item from the sidebar Admin Panel. Just click on it.
 3. If there are some plugins or themes that can be updated, they will appear here, right below the part which tells you if a new version of WordPress is available or not.
 4. To update your plugins, select them and click on the ‘Update Plugins’ button. The same can be done with themes: select them and click ‘Update Themes’.
 5. Whether for plugins or for themes, you will be led to another page which will inform you about the progress of the update, just as it does with the WordPress update.

>Note that for plugins, another section will also allow you to update in one click: the ‘Installed Plugins’ section in the Dashboard. If a plugin can be updated, a message will appear right below it, with a link to update it automatically. You can even select all of your plugins and chose ‘Update’ in the drop down list to bulk update the ones that need it.
